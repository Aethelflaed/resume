# Geoffroy Planquart

Hi! I'm a software developer from Strasbourg, France, currently
CTO & Co-Founder at [Epopia](https://www.epopia.com/en/),
a start-up creating a new media to get children to read and write.

You may also find a lot of my work/contributions on:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/610351/geoffroy)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffroyplanquart/)

Nowadays, I mainly use Ruby on Rails & MongoDB, but my skillset is all about creating a
software architecture and algorithms to solve many problems.

## Education

- Currently studying linguistics at Strasbourg University
- Master degree in Computer Science at Supinfo International University (2009-2014)

## work

- CTO & Co-founder at Epopia since november 2012, a company for which I created a cutting-edge NLG tool
  which also handles most of the start-up business and our 20k+ subscriptions

- Programmer at Sogeti, a CapGemini subsidary, from 2011 to 2014 where I mainly worked 
  on R&D projects involving the creation of an Augmented Reality framework
  (mainly for Windows Phone & Android). The framework handled indoor, markerless and location-based
  AR objects presented on-screen.

  I also had to work 6 month for a French bank as a consultant, where I rewrote the security
  layer of their ATM software and initiated a new project for a complete rewrote of the system
  (which dated from 1993), laying out the initial architecture.

- Freelancer since 2008, I created a few websites in my free time, taught computer architecture and
  AI.

## Skills

- expert in Ruby & Ruby on Rails
  I use this language everyday and had to hack my way around most of the framework to get a deeper
  understanding and adapt it to our needs

- Web front-end, HTML5, CSS, Javascript
  Although I'm not a UI/UX expert, I can get things done and understand how Javascript works.

- C++ up to 11, including advance technics like SFINAE

- MongoDB, not the admin part but getting to use it correctly including map/reduce, aggregation
  pipeline
